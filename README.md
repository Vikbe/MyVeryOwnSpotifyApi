# MyVeryOwnSpotifyApi
A small api service for searching for artists on spotify.

The application requires visual studio 2019 and .NET 5 to build and run.
It has a swagger interface that exposes the Search endpoint where you can enter a search query for an artist.
It requires ClientID and ClientSecret to be filled out in AuthConfig.json to be able to use the spotify bearer token authentication.
